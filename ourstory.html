My name is Cristina Toledo and I am the founder of 360 Kitchen. But it wasn't always called this way. When I was 
fifteen, I started my own bakery called 350 Bakery where I sold a famous Guatemalan cake called tres leches. 
Three years later, at the end of my freshman year, I felt physically and emotionally unwell. I had lived a life 
full of excess -- eating junk food, never missing a party, barely sleeping, and being constantly busy and focused on the future
that I never enjoyed the present moment. When I began my sophomore year, I decided to turn my life around and 
start taking care of my body by eating nourishing foods and exercising. I felt amazing. However, 
about a year later, I began to become obsessed with clean eating and being active. I stopped selling my 
cakes because they were full of sugar and dairy -- foods I no longer consumed. When I put my health at risk by
taking my nutrition to an extreme, I realized that there are other aspects of myself that are equally important of care and love:
 my mind and my soul. On October 2019, I decided to re-brand my business from 350 Bakery to 360 Kitchen. 
 360 represents the degrees of a circle -- which represents balance. At 360 Kitchen, I want to inspire
 others to have the courage to live their lives at 360 degrees: balanced, nurtured, connected, and empowered.
