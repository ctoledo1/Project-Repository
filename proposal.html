    <h1> 360 Kitchen Website</h1>

    <h2>What My Website is About...</h2>
    I chose this class with the mission to strengthen my programming skills. I have taken QTM 3 and Business Intelligence and Data Analytics 
    but I wanted to learn how to program website which is as skill that, as entrepreneur, I knew would be a great addition to my personal and business  tool kit. 
    Last fall, I launced my own business '360 Kitchen'. At 360 Kitchen, I sell homemade nutricious muffins made with natural ingredients: sugar-free,
    gluten-free, and dairy-free. I sold muffins in my apartment building to other students and also on campus to classmates and professors. When I unexpectedly 
    had to return to Guatemala from studying abroad this march due to COVID-19 I knew that it was the time to launch my business in Guatemala. I contacted a programming 
    start-up that charged me a large amount of money for a website that I couldn't afford since I had been running for only a couple of weeks. So when it was announced
    that we could chose our own project topic I knew exactly what I was going to do...360 Kitchen's website!

<br>
    <h2>Why My Website is Important...</h2>
    My website is important because it will help me transmit information about my business to my customers in a quicker and more effective way. Right now, I am only 
    using Instagram as my selling platform and I have to send my customers the menu separetely through chat. Also, I have many pictures of my muffins but my customers may be unsure
    of which flavor is the muffin in the picture. By having a website, I can have pictures next to my menu as well as important information about the 
    muffins (like ingredients and prices) as well as my story with pictures to give a more humane side to my business. 
<br>
    <h2>My Target Audience</h2>
    My target audience is the customers of my business. They live in Guatemala City, are ages mostly around ages 18-50 years old and are attracted to 
    eating sugar-free, gluten-free, and dairy-free either because of intolarnces, allergies, or sicknesses like diabetes or because of health and wellness. 
<br>
    <h2>My Target Audience</h2>
    The content I want to include in my website is most importantly, the menu and pictures of each muffin and its flavors with ingredients and price. I also want to have 
    a page on 'My Story' and why I decided to embark on this entrepreneurial journey. I also want my homepage to be super easthetically pleasing with pictures of my muffins and my packaging.
